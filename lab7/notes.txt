Fast PWN Mode: 
Timer/Counter0 consists of 3 registers:
- Timer/Counter 0 register:			TCNT0
- Output Compare Register 0:		OCR0
- Timer/Counter Control Register 0: TCCR0

Most basic way to use: Write value to TCNT0 and let it
count up to max value 
-> Timer/Counter Overflow 0 (TOV0) is set
-> Detect:	manually: section 5.4.4
			generate interrupt 5.4.3
-> Elapsed time: Page ...

The exact behavior of Timer/Counter0 depends on its mode of operation 
(see Section 5.4.4), which is controlled by setting TCCR0 (see Section 5.4.5).

Enable TOV0 and OCF0 as interrupt by configuring 
Timer/Counter Interrupt Mask Register TIMSK

OCF0 and TOV0 flags are masked by OCIE0 and TOIE0 bits, respectively, in TIMSK
OCIE0 and TOIE bits must be set to 1 to enable these interrupts

Format of TCCR0: page 163
Set up TCCR0 with not prescale: CS02 = CS01 = 0; CS00 = 1
Set up Fast PWM mode: WGM01 = 1; WGM00 = 1, 

COMM01 and COMM00: See page 164
FOC0: See page 164



Fast PWM: (page 161)
- TCNT0 counts up from BOTTOM(0x00) to MAX (0xFF) then restarts at BOTTOM
For a non-inverted PWM output, OC0 signal is set to 0 when TCNT0 and OCR0 match,
and is set to 1 when the computer transitions from 0xFF to 0x00.
